<p class="page_text2">book and lyrics by Sam Salmond<br /> music by Will Aronson</p>
<p><em>Mother, Me &amp; the Monsters (formerly 'Mormons, Mothers and Monsters')</em> uses comedy and heightened theatricality to explore the rocky path to reconciliation between a mother and her estranged son. The show is based on the true story of Sam's relationship with his mother over the course of three divorces - and four dads - and his evolving friendship with the monster under his bed.&nbsp; The show was first presented in a workshop-production by Barrington Stage in July 2011 under the direction of Adrienne Campbell-Holt, and was named a Critic's Pick by the Boston Globe.</p>
