			<p><i>The Trouble With Doug</i> is a contemporary comedic re-imagining of&nbsp;Franz Kafka&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;The Metamorphosis.&rdquo; On the eve of his 27th birthday, Doug Gregory transforms from a happy and healthy young man into a giant garden slug. Family relationships undergo their own surprising metamorphoses as the Gregory clan confronts the loss of the son they knew.</p>

			<p>The show&nbsp;was presented at the 2010 NAMT Festival of New Musicals under the direction of Victoria Clark, and has also been developed at CAP21, Royal &amp; Derngate, and TheatreWorks (Palo Alto). In April 2014, a production of <em>Doug</em>&nbsp;opened at the Theater at Arts Garage in Delray Beach, FL.&nbsp;</p>
