  <em>“Mormons, Mothers and Monsters is an entertaining new musical, with peppy songs, clever lyrics and a most unusual coming-of-age story… a totally original new work by two major new talents.”</em><br />
        <br /><span style="margin:0 40px;"></span>- Larry Murray, Berkshire On Stage (<a href="http://berkshireonstage.com/2011/07/21/mormons-mothers-and-monsters-fresh-from-the-musical-theatre-lab-at-barrington-stage/" target="_blank">Read the Full Review</a>)<br /><br />
        <em>“Although Mormons, Mothers & Monsters is a musical for four actors, it is completely fulfilling and actually comes across as something larger. That in great part is due to Will Aronson's generally jaunty score which steadily propels the show forward but also quite deliberately masks a great deal of the pain that is simmering just beneath the surface… The music, while often ebullient and heartfelt, also incorporates an underlying irony that helps assure that, despite the frequent absurdity in the story, there is seldom a false emotional moment on stage.”</em><br />
