<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="margin:0 40px;"></span>- Jae-Hyun Kwan, Dong-Ah Daily News</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>&ldquo;Heart-throbbing first love, more vivid than the original film&hellip; the new waltz is as elegant as the [Shostakovich] waltz in the film.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="margin:0 40px;"></span>- Bo-Mi Park, Hankyeore News</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>"The music is the most outstanding element. The strings sound rich and fill the space; the music fits the warm and soft feelings of the show. Breaking away from the film&rsquo;s famous Shostakovich waltz and using an original waltz is one example of how the musical creates its own reason to exist. &lsquo;Rain Song,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mountain Song,&rsquo; &lsquo;I Guess That's It,&rsquo; &lsquo;Barely,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Condemnation&rsquo; all have their own stories, while staying coherent&hellip; Bungee Jump succeeds at being a high-quality original musical based on a film. It provides a clue that it is possible to create a well-made show based on a film, which still has its own reason to be seen.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em>"The beautiful songs are receiving a lot of attention&hellip; When I interviewed [lead actor] Woohyung Kim, he said, &lsquo;All the songs are so amazing,&rsquo; and it turns out that he wasn't exaggerating. I give applause to lyricist Hue Park and composer Will Aronson, who created the beautiful score."</em></p>
