			<p><em>Bungee Jump</em> is an adaptation of the 2001 South Korean cult hit 번지점프를 하다. The show takes place simultaneously in two time periods: In the summer of 1983, Inwoo and TaeHee meet and begin to fall in love, but eventually are separated by a tragic accident. 17 years later, Inwoo is a high school Korean teacher who starts to believe that popular student HyunBin is somehow, impossibly, the reincarnation of TaeHee.</p>

			<p><em>Bungee Jump</em> opened on July 14th, 2012 at the 1000-seat Blue Square Theater in Seoul, and subsequently won Best Score at both of Korea&#39;s major awards events: the 18th annual &#39;Korea Musical Awards&#39; at Seoul Olympic Park, and the 7th annual &#39;The Musical Awards,&#39; at the National Theatre of Korea. A second production opened on September 27, 2013 at Yonkang Hall.</p>
